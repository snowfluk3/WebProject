Prompt #1: I have been tasked with making an "about me" page for a fictitious coffee shop named 
"The Brew on Cordova" for my Fundamental Web Technology course. 
We've learned a few basics of HTML and CSS, but I have no idea where to start here. 
Please provide some basic code to work from. The overall style of the page should be stylish and warm.

Prompt #2: How can I rotate from left to right with each team member? 

Prompt #3: I'm struggling to make my webpage mobile-friendly. 
Specifically, the about section looks atrocious on mobile, with the image bullying the text out onto the side of the screen. 
The team section does look better with the text going properly under the image, though on mobile the images still exceed 
the allotted box, which isn't ideal. Help fix please!

Prompt #4: Great, so the default desktop view, and the mobile view are working properly, but if I do a minimized view on desktop, 
then it breaks, with the text being bullied out to the side by the images. 
How can I make it so that it behaves similarly to the mobile view, with the image on top, text on bottom, 
for smaller desktop screens? (For the chat references)
